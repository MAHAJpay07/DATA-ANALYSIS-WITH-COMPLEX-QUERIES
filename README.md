*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*

Advanced SQL Data Analysis â€“ Internship Task (CodTech)
This repository contains SQL queries that demonstrate advanced data analysis techniques using Window Functions, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL Server.

Overview
As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, this task focuses on extracting insights and identifying patterns from a sample sales dataset using complex SQL queries. The goal is to showcase the practical use of advanced SQL constructs in real-world data scenarios.

1.Techniques Used
a.Window Functions
Used for calculating running totals, rankings, and analyzing data across partitions without collapsing rows.

b.Subqueries
Applied for comparing values with aggregated results, filtering data dynamically, and isolating logic within larger queries.

c.CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
Enhance readability and modularize complex queries. Used for monthly summaries and layered logic.

ðŸ“Š Sample Insights Demonstrated
I.Running total of sales per employee over time

II.Employees with sales above the average

III.Monthly sales summaries for each employee

IV.Highest sales per employee using ranking

These queries highlight the power of advanced SQL for meaningful business insights and report generation.
